So I have created a uniquechar.py file which performs our main code in that function name is unique .
After that i created this file as wheel file using setuptools package for converting it into package we need to create a pyproject.toml file which specifies our dependicies 
and create the require package for us
using command-  python -m build
next i pushed the code into github by .gitignore (ignoring some directories)
